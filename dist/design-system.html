  <h3 id="firsth3">Overview</h3>
  <p>As a part of my work on redesigning GlassesUSA, I led the design system for approx. 2 years.  <br>
    This project involved creating the foundations of the design system, maintaining it over time, and making improvements based on feedback from the Design and the Dev teams.
  <br> <br>
    This design system is also being used as the base of multiple other design systems, <span style="font-weight: 500;">including UnitedHealthcare Vision</span> & United Vision Plan. Over 11 designers use it on a daily basis.

  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Before this project, the design team didn't have an easy way of sharing styles and components across projects. As a result, the team ended up duplicating design elements, which caused visual inconsistencies and increased the complexity of the codebase.
  <br> <br>
    Every week I took part in a Frontend oriented discussion concerning changes and new ideas. As the design system grew beyond merely components, I created new guidelines for the company such as only using SVGs, creating Touch Targets for each element, and adding skeletons (loaders) for every new screen.

  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">While working on the design system often means spending time in Figma to add/remove/update components and patterns, my main goal was to create an effective tool for designers to get the job done.
  <br> <br>
    Some of the components and interaction were also coded by me, in order to make sure that it came out exactly as I envisioned.
    Check out some of the component demos I created in Codepen - <br><a href="https://codepen.io/evya/pen/BaWpKYa" target="_blank">Checkbox component</a>,  <a href="https://codepen.io/evya/pen/MWppZVL" target="_blank">Radio Button component</a> and the  <a href="https://codepen.io/evya/pen/YzGLQYM" target="_blank">arrow animation</a>.
  <br> <br>
  The new design system allowed the design team to build a variety of consistent and unified features. It has also helped the engineering team to simplify and unify their respective codebases.
