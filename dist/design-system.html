  <h3 id="firsth3">Overview</h3>
  <p>As a part of my work on redesigning GlassesUSA, I’m leading the design system for 2 years.  <br>
    This project involved creating the foundations of the design system, maintaining it over time, and making improvements based on feedback from the design and the dev teams. Over 11 designers use it on a daily basis.
  <br> <br>
    This design system is also used as the base of multiple other design systems, including UnitedHealthcare Vision & United Vision Plan.

  <p>Before this project, the design team haven’t had an easy way of sharing styles and components across projects. As a result the team ended up duplicating design elements, which caused visual inconsistencies and increased the complexity of codebases.
  <br> <br>
    Every week I took part in a front-end discussion concerning changes and new ideas. As the design system grew beyond merely components, I created new guidelines for the company such as using only SVGs, creating Touch Targets for each element, and adding skeletons (loaders) for every new screen.

  <p>While working on the design system often means spending time in Figma to add/remove/update components and patterns, I also wanted to make sure the primary goal of providing an effective tool for designers on the team remained the main objective.
  <br> <br>
    The new design system allowed the design team to build a variety of consistent and unified features. It has also helped the engineering team to simplify and unify their respective codebases.
  <br> <br>
    Some of the components and interaction were also coded by me, in order to make sure it came out exactly as I envisioned.
