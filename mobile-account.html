  <h3 id="firsth3">Overview</h3>
  <p>GlassesUSA.com is an online glasses and contact lenses retailer, with over 3,000,000 monthly users.
  </br></br>
  “My Account” is a place on the website where you can control and view personal information, get updates, manage subscription plans and find help and other useful information. 
  “My Account” is an integral part of the product’s experience and has a significant influence on the whole user shopping experience. This is often a main factor in whether the user will return in the future.  
  </br></br>
  GlassesUSA’s “My Account” was previously in a horrendous state - missing key features, an unsightly UI, and a bad experience overall, both on desktop and mobile devices. Because of that, it was deemed necessary to design the mobile version from scratch, and not base it on the current version.

  <h3>How I worked</h3>
  <p>The whole project was handled by me. I worked with a Product Manager who gave me full control over decisions and executions. The work on the project included UX Research, Wireframing, Prototyping and Interface design.
  </br> </br> The whole process was done by following the method of “Design Thinking”.
  </p>

  <h3>Empathize and define</h3>
  <p>According to the “Design Thinking” methodology, I’ve started with the first stage - Empathize.</br>
    In order to do that I’ve done a few steps:</br></p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Talked with the customer support team and checked customer support data from calls, chats and emails.</li>
      <li>Looked at the old “My Account” mobile and desktop data</li>
      <li>Made observations on users using the old “My Account”.</li>
      <li>Interviewed multiple users</li>
      <li>Ran Usability Tests.</li>
      <li>Condacted a thorough competitor analysis. </li>

    </ul>
      
  <p> Afterwards, I started working on the second step - “Define”. I analyzed the information from the first step and came up with guidelines that served as the bases for the whole project.

  <h3>Dynamic cards</h3>
  <p>The “Ideate” step included creating a clear plan to implement the aforementioned points. One of the ideas I came up with was implementing “Dynamic Cards” that are located at the top of the “My Account” page and display the most relevant information for the user. This solution works like magic, and is similar to “Siri Suggestions” on iOS, which primarily focuses on important, relevant and urgent information. 
  </br> </br> Most users access “My Account” in order to view information about an active order, therefore I placed an informative “Dynamic Card'' when an order is active. This card contains the order status and updates at the very top. Another example - a user who bought glasses and is missing prescriptions, thus preventing the creation of the item, will receive a “Dynamic Card” reminding them to upload a valid prescription. Other instances include payment issues, expiring prescriptions, reordering contacts etc.

  <h3>Finding missing revenue opportunities</h3>
  <p>While working on the project I came across (and carried through) opportunities where certain features could be implemented in a way that could increase the potential revenue.</br>
    For example, providing an option to extend the frame protection plan when it’s about to expire, and recommending an option to do an online paid eye exam when a prescription is outdated.

  <h3>Final Design</h3>
  <p> The Final Design provides a clean and easy-to-use solution for the problems detailed above.
