I also created for them a new design language. \n   <br>\n    The company tested the project with A/B testing and the results exceeded expectations -  a statistically significant 20% paid users conversion rate increase for a multi-million dollar company.        \n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/fc09f0aa0fee548754bb09469037ce89.png\" alt=\"\">\n  \n\n  <h3>Clear & easy experience</h3>\n  <p>The checkout wizard is one of the most important pages in an e-com site - the user already showed intent to buy the product and this is their final step. We must not lose the customer at this critical stage.\n    Non-functional design is bad practice, especially for businesses.<br>\n    First thing I focused on was to create a clear and usable user experience, by dividing the information into 3 stages, creating an easier process for the users.\n    Users want to know why and what they're buying. By providing the user all the crucial information, we keep them in the funnel.\n  </p>\n\n  \n  <img src=\"/a047f9bbd0df40ed15d4eabf9d9291f2.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <img src=\"/1b379c5f909cf659080f41e068f838c7.png\" alt=\"\">\n  \n  <h3>Addressing users' hesitations</h3>\n  <p>Other issues concern the users hesitations about the site's security, reliability and the ordered product quality. By adding various components I have addressed each of these concerns to give the user a carefree experience.\n    </p>\n  <img src=\"/16fdefcb162054676e6eac4750340e65.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <img src=\"/2cc1d256d2b6e5d758df7508aec38bbf.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <p>Each element has an effect on the result, if something seems unusual to the user it must be explained. <br>\n    For example, to proactively ease users' concerns about providing their information, an explanation is added about how the information will be used, and why it is required.\n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/f92651fa4dc86ad1a4a7a0e72145cfc4.png\" alt=\"\">\n \n  <h3>Reducing friction</h3>\n  <p>In order to reduce the friction with the user, I’ve added and changed certain aspects throughout the whole shopping experience.<br>\n    For example, a feature of auto-completion of your shipping address during the checkout, including street name, postal code, city and state. <br>\n    Another feature I’ve added is being able to continue with the purchase as a guest, significantly reducing the friction created in the process of signing up.    \n    </p>\n  <img src=\"/1aac2f7533b7fe2820ad9731fc43b057.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n  <h3>Creating a new design language</h3>\n  <p> The client had a desire for a new modern feel for the product.<br>\n    Working closely with Smartrike's art director, we chose a new friendly and inviting design language, that is suitable for the target audience.<br>\n    All elements are documented in a design system library, such as buttons, colors, typography, spacing, and components.\n    </p>\n  <img src=\"/16fdefcb162054676e6eac4750340e65.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <p>The conducted research and new design language brought to the design showcased below.
