id=\"firsth3\">Overview</h3>\n  <p>Smartrike is an industry leader in ride-on-toys with over 20,000,000 customers, they hired me to research and design a new checkout wizard for them. I also created for them a new design language. \n   <br> <br>\n    The company tested the project with A/B testing and the results exceeded expectations -  <span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">statistically significant 20% paid users conversion rate increase for a multi-million dollar company. </span>       \n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/7a862c5298f02dc7db658c67f39c782d.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <p class=\"small_text\">Old Checkout design</p>\n\n\n  <h3>Clear & easy experience</h3>\n  <p>The checkout wizard is one of the most important pages in an e-com site - the user already showed intent to buy the product and this is their final step. We must not lose the customer at this critical stage.\n    Non-functional design is bad practice, especially for businesses.<br> <br>\n    First thing I focused on was to create a clear and usable user experience, by dividing the information into 3 stages, creating an easier process for the users.\n    Users want to know why and what they're buying. By providing the user all the crucial information, we keep them in the funnel.\n  </p>\n\n  \n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/e63df1e57e869957855f6cb7cfcd8fd0.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <p class=\"small_text\">  New basic layout structure #1  </p>\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/8ed129b4841e9c4bf7b1a624da8c1eb3.png\" alt=\"\">\n  <p class=\"small_text\">  New basic layout structure  #2 </p>\n\n  \n  <h3>Addressing users' hesitations</h3>\n  <p>Other issues concern the users hesitations about the site's security, reliability and the ordered product quality.
